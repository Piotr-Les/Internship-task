# Seat reservation internship task

in order to properly run this app:
1) open terminal run: npm run api 
2) open second terminal window run: npm start
3) the app is programmed to fetch data from api on: http://localhost:3000/seats 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm run api`

Runs server to deliver api data on port [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

if you run: **npm run api** first the app will run on 
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
which is correct and intended

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
I only added a few basic tests to check if components render and reducers work as intended.
